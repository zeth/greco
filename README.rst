Greco - Green Code learning game.

Learn Green Code in a friendly way!

Greco is a very basic typing game where a word in Green Code is
displayed and then you need to type in using your keyboard.

Consistently accurate typing will result in gaining a level and being
rewarded with a silly catchphrase.

Green code is a whimsical language so start slowly, don't take it
seriously and don't forget to have fun!

Requires PyGame to be installed (normal PyGame or pygame_sdl2, either
will work).
